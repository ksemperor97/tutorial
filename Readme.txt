This page is for tutorial. 

I tried some basic git code on my mac terminal. 

I refer the website to learn git and GitHub. 

Here is the url of the site. 

https://nolboo.kim/blog/2013/10/06/github-for-beginner/

The references of this page are also useful, because this page just give brief introduction. 

I want to know what happens if this file is changed. 

Let's change this file again.

Nothing happened.
